Net-SeedServe version 0.2.0
===========================

The purpose of this module is to implement a server for a TCP server for
pseudo-random number generator seeds. What happens is that whenever a random
number generator is initialized without a seed, it contacts the seed server
to get one, and so it's behaviour can be controlled.

One can control the seeds that the seed server will serve using the API.
